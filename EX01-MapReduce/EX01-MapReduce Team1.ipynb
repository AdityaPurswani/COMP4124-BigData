    "## Lab assignment: Exercises with MapReduce \n",
    "\n",
    "This first lab is all about the MapReduce paradigm. You have four different exercises that you have to resolve using MapReduce at a conceptual level. In particular, you are asked to define how the `map` and `reduce` functions should be implemented to parallelise the different tasks. You need to fill in the markdown boxes that say ''YOUR ANSWER HERE'' below to produce the expected output. For each exercise, you have to include a **brief explanation** and a **drawing** of your MapReduce solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the drawings, you should use a similar style to what we did in the lecture for the Word Count example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/wordcount.jpg \"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You can just draw the figures by hand and take a picture with your phone. You can include a picture in the markdown (it needs to be a Text cell!) using `![](name.jpg)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you describe well how the `map` and `reduce` functions will work. For the Word Count example, (1) the `map` sends out every word as the output key, and gives a '1' to the output value to count that word; (2) the `reduce` simply reduces the list of 1s by adding up their elements: `lambda x, y: x+y`, with the reduction processing happening in pairs of two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission and marking criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "You should complete this notebook and add your solutions to it. When you are done, create a single .zip file, called `ex01.zip` that contains your completed notebook (ex01.ipynb) and all the images to your solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important notes:\n",
    "- The **group leader** must submit the `ex01.zip` file on Moodle.\n",
    "- **Each member of the group** must complete the peer review survey and their contribution statement using this [link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=7qe9Z4D970GskTWEGCkKHjZupmfSK6JKqlvGZrucaoBUMjcxV1BYVk83U0hKNUtITlkzRTY0MkhHMCQlQCN0PWcu). **You can only submit this survey ONCE**.\n",
    "- This lab is marked out of 100 marks, and each exercise is worth 25 marks.\n",
    "- The marking will be focused on:\n",
    "    - Clarity of the diagrams and explanations; they should follow the same style used in the lectures. \n",
    "    - The explanations demonstrate that you understand well the concept of MapReduce.\n",
    "    - Efficiency of the solution.\n",
    "- **Submission deadline: 19th February 2024 at 3pm**\n",
